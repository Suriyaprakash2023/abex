# SEO Blog Generator

This project is a **SEO Blog Generator** built with **Streamlit** and **OpenAI's GPT-3.5**. The application generates SEO-optimized blog posts on a topic provided by the user. The generated blog includes key sections like **headings**, **subheadings**, and **SEO keywords**. Additionally, it highlights important keywords in the content to ensure SEO optimization.

## Features
- **Model Selection**: The user can choose between **GPT-3.5** (free) and **GPT-4** (paid) models to generate content.
- **SEO Optimization**: The generated content is optimized with relevant keywords such as **HR**, **Human Resources**, **Employee Engagement**, etc.
- **Highlighting Key Points**: Important concepts such as **Employee Engagement** and **HR Trends** are bolded in the generated content for better readability.
- **Formatted Content**: The content is well-structured with **headings** (`<h2>`), **bolded** key points, and SEO-friendly formatting.
- **Downloadable Content**: The user can download the SEO-optimized content as a `.txt` file.
